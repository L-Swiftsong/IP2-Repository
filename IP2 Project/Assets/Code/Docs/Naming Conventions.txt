Lexy:
	I am following the C# Naming Conventions laid out by Microsoft on the documentation page located here: 'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names'
	It is recommended that everyone in a project follows the same naming conventions so as to avoid needing to interpret their changes in differing scripts,
		however it is up to you all whether we stick with this style of naming conventions or use another.
