#IP2-Repository
	A GitHub Repository for our IP2 module. This allows us to work on the project simultaneously, gives us access to source control, and allows us to better manage conflicts that will inevitably crop up when merging files.

This is the ReadME doccument. If there is anything that we require to know before the opening of this project, put it here.


Who can access this repository? - Only those whom are invited to the repository can edit it, however I have made it public so that lecturers and such can view it (Though not edit).
	Our entire group should be able to edit this, though if you cannot, tell me and I can give your GitHub account permission to do so.
How can you edit this repository - You can clone down this repository from the cloud easily using GitHub Desktop, and any changes you make to that can then be committed and pushed to the cloud.
	Note - Branching: If you are editing the project files (Scripts, scenes, artwork, etc) in a non-minor way, I reccomend creating a new branch until you are finished and the feature works. This will allow the main branch to maintain its integrity, & it should allow for easier merging if a file has been edited by two different people.
